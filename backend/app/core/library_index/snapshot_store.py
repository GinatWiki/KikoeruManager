"""SnapshotStore：索引数据的 PostgreSQL CRUD 层。

职责边界：
- 只管读写 `library_index_entries` / `library_index_status` 两张表
- 不做扫描、不做路径解析、不做 RJ 号提取
- 上层 scanner / watcher 以 IndexEntry / WatcherEvent 为单位和本层交互

幂等语义：
- upsert 用 (library_id, generation, relative_path) 判重
- bulk_upsert 会把同一库存、generation、相对路径的重复条目去重，保留最后一个
